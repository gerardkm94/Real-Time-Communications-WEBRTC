    abstract = {{Traditional network architectures are ill-suited to meet the requirements of today's enterprises, carriers, and end users. Thanks to a broad industry effort spearheaded by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF), Software- Defined Networking (SDN) is transforming networking architecture. In the SDN architecture, the control and data planes are decoupled, network intelligence and state are logically centralized, and the underlying network infrastructure is abstracted from the applications. As a result, enterprises and carriers gain unprecedented programmability, automation, and network control, enabling them to build highly scalable, flexible networks that readily adapt to changing business needs. The ONF is a non-profit industry consortium that is leading the advancement of SDN and standardizing critical elements of the SDN architecture such as the OpenFlow protocol, which structures communication between the control and data planes of supported network devices. OpenFlow is the first standard interface designed specifically for SDN, providing high-performance, granular traffic control across multiple vendors' network devices. OpenFlow-based SDN is currently being rolled out in a variety of networking devices and software, delivering substantial benefits to both enterprises and carriers, including: Centralized management and control of networking devices from multiple vendors; Improved automation and management by using common APIs to abstract the underlying networking details from the orchestration and provisioning systems and applications; Rapid innovation through the ability to deliver new network capabilities and services without the need to configure individual devices or wait for vendor releases; Programmability by operators, enterprises, independent software vendors, and users (not just equipment manufacturers) using common programming environments, which gives all parties new opportunities to drive revenue and differentiation; Increased network reliability and security as a result of centralized and automated management of network devices, uniform policy enforcement, and fewer configuration errors; More granular network control with the ability to apply comprehensive and wide-ranging policies at the session, user, device, and application levels; and Better end-user experience as applications exploit centralized network state information to seamlessly adapt network behavior to user needs. SDN is a dynamic and flexible network architecture that protects existing investments while future-proofing the network. With SDN, today's static network can evolve into an extensible service delivery platform capable of responding rapidly to changing business, end-user, and market needs.}},
